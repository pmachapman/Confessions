								By downloading or using the app, these terms will
								automatically apply to you &ndash; you should make sure therefore
								that you read them carefully before using the app. You&rsquo;re not
								allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
								our trademarks in any way. You&rsquo;re not allowed to attempt to
								extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn&rsquo;t try
								to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
								versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
								database rights and other intellectual property rights related
								to it, still belong to Conglomo Limited.
							</p>
							<p>
								Conglomo Limited is committed to ensuring that the app is
								as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
								reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
								its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
								charge you for the app or its services without making it very
								clear to you exactly what you&rsquo;re paying for.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Creeds and Confessions app stores and processes personal data that
								you have provided to us, in order to provide our
								Service. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to keep your phone and
								access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
								not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
								removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
								official operating system of your device. It could make your
								phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
								compromise your phone&rsquo;s security features and it could mean
								that the Creeds and Confessions app won&rsquo;t work properly or at all.
							</p>
							<div>

									The app does use third party services that declare their own
									Terms and Conditions.

								You should be aware that there are certain things that
								Conglomo Limited will not take responsibility for. Certain
								functions of the app will require the app to have an active
								internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
								by your mobile network provider, but Conglomo Limited
								cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
								functionality if you don&rsquo;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&rsquo;t
								have any of your data allowance left.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you&rsquo;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
								should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
								mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
								be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
								the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
								other third party charges. In using the app, you&rsquo;re accepting
								responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
								charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
								(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
								you are not the bill payer for the device on which you&rsquo;re
								using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
								received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
							</p>
							<p>
								Along the same lines, Conglomo Limited cannot always take
								responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
								make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of
								battery and you can&rsquo;t turn it on to avail the Service,
								Conglomo Limited cannot accept responsibility.
							</p>
							<p>
								With respect to Conglomo Limited&rsquo;s responsibility for your
								use of the app, when you&rsquo;re using the app, it&rsquo;s important to
								bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
								updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
								to provide information to us so that we can make it available
								to you. Conglomo Limited accepts no liability for any
								loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
								relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
							</p>
							<p>
								At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
								currently available on Android &amp; iOS &ndash; the requirements for
								both systems (and for any additional systems we
								decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
								and you&rsquo;ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
								using the app. Conglomo Limited does not promise that it
								will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
								and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
								installed on your device. However, you promise to always
								accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
								also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
								it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
								Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
								rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
								(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
								from your device.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
							<p>
								We may update our Terms and Conditions
								from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
								periodically for any changes. We will
								notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
								Conditions on this page.
							</p>
							<p>
								These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-08-28
							</p>
							<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
							<p>
								If you have any questions or suggestions about our
								Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us
