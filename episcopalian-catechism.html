							<h3 id="p">Concerning the Catechism</h3>
							<p>This catechism is primarily intended for use by parish priests, deacons, and lay catechists, to give an outline for instruction. It is a commentary on the creeds, but is not meant to be a complete statement of belief and practice; rather, it is a point of departure for the teacher, and it is cast in the traditional question and answer form for ease of reference.</p>
							<p>The second use of this catechism is to provide a brief summary of the Church&rsquo;s teaching for an inquiring stranger who picks up a Prayer Book.</p>
							<p>It may also be used to form a simple service; since the matter is arranged under headings, it is suitable for selective use, and the leader may introduce prayers and hymns as needed.</p>
							<h3>An Outline of the Faith<br>commonly called the Catechism</h3>
							<h4 id="s01">Human Nature</h4>
							<p>Q. What are we by nature?<br>
							A. We are part of God&rsquo;s creation, made in the image of God.</p>
							<p>Q. What does it mean to be created in the image of God?<br>
							A. It means that we are free to make choices: to love, to create, to reason, and to live in harmony with creation and with God.</p>
							<p>Q. Why then do we live apart from God and out of harmony with creation?<br>
							A. From the beginning, human beings have misused their freedom and made wrong choices.</p>
							<p>Q. Why do we not use our freedom as we should?<br>
							A. Because we rebel against God, and we put ourselves in the place of God.</p>
							<p>Q. What help is there for us?<br>
							A. Our help is in God.</p>
							<p>Q. How did God first help us?<br>
							A. God first helped us by revealing himself and his will, through nature and history, through many seers and saints, and especially through the prophets of Israel.
							<h4 id="s02">God the Father</h4>
							<p>Q. What do we learn about God as creator from the revelation to Israel?<br>
							A. We learn that there is one God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>
							<p>Q. What does this mean?<br>
							A. This means that the universe is good, that it is the work of a single loving God who creates, sustains, and directs it.</p>
							<p>Q. What does this mean about our place in the universe?<br>
							A. It means that the world belongs to its creator; and that we are called to enjoy it and to care for it in accordance with God&rsquo;s purposes.</p>
							<p>Q. What does this mean about human life?<br>
							A. It means that all people are worthy of respect and honor, because all are created in the image of God, and all can respond to the love of God.</p>
							<p>Q. How was this revelation handed down to us?<br>
							A. This revelation was handed down to us through a community created by a covenant with God.
							<h4 id="s03">The Old Covenant</h4>
							<p>Q. What is meant by a covenant with God?<br>
							A. A covenant is a relationship initiated by God, to which a body of people responds in faith.</p>
							<p>Q. What is the Old Covenant?<br>
							A. The Old Covenant is the one given by God to the Hebrew people.</p>
							<p>Q. What did God promise them?<br>
							A. God promised that they would be his people to bring all the nations of the world to him.</p>
							<p>Q. What response did God require from the chosen people?<br>
							A. God required the chosen people to be faithful; to love justice, to do mercy, and to walk humbly with their God.</p>
							<p>Q. Where is this Old Covenant to be found?<br>
							A. The covenant with the Hebrew people is to be found in the books which we call the Old Testament.</p>
							<p>Q. Where in the Old Testament is God&rsquo;s will for us shown most clearly?<br>
							A. God&rsquo;s will for us is shown most clearly in the Ten Commandments.
							<h4 id="s04">The Ten Commandments</h4>
							<p>Q. What are the Ten Commandments?<br>
							A. The Ten Commandments are the laws given to Moses and the people of Israel.</p>
							<p>Q. What do we learn from these commandments?<br>
							A. We learn two things: our duty to God, and our duty to our neighbors.</p>
							<p>Q. What is our duty to God?<br>
							A. Our duty is to believe and trust in God;</p>
							<ol type="i" class="upper">
							<li>To love and obey God and to bring others to know him;</li>
							<li>To put nothing in the place of God;</li>
							<li>To show God respect in thought, word, and deed;</li>
							<li>And to set aside regular times for worship, prayer, and the study of God&rsquo;s ways.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Q. What is our duty to our neighbors?<br>
							A. Our duty to our neighbors is to love them as ourselves, and to do to other people as we wish them to do to us;</p>
							<ol type="i" class="upper" start="5">
							<li>To love, honor, and help our parents and family; to honor those in authority, and to meet their just demands;</li>
							<li>To show respect for the life God has given us; to work and pray for peace; to bear no malice, prejudice, or hatred in our hearts; and to be kind to all the creatures of God;</li>
							<li>To use all our bodily desires as God intended;</li>
							<li>To be honest and fair in our dealings; to seek justice, freedom, and the necessities of life for all people; and to use our talents and possessions as ones who must answer for them to God;</li>
							<li>To speak the truth, and not to mislead others by our silence;</li>
							<li>To resist temptations to envy, greed, and jealousy; to rejoice in other people&rsquo;s gifts and graces; and to do our duty for the love of God, who has called us into fellowship with him.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Q. What is the purpose of the Ten Commandments?<br>
							A. The Ten Commandments were given to define our relationship with God and our neighbors.</p>
							<p>Q. Since we do not fully obey them, are they useful at all?<br>
							A. Since we do not fully obey them, we see more clearly our sin and our need for redemption.
							<h4 id="s05">Sin and Redemption</h4>
							<p>Q. What is sin?<br>
							A. Sin is the seeking of our own will instead of the will of God, thus distorting our relationship with God, with other people, and with all creation.</p>
							<p>Q. How does sin have power over us?<br>
							A. Sin has power over us because we lose our liberty when our relationship with God is distorted.</p>
							<p>Q. What is redemption?<br>

							<p>Q. How did God prepare us for redemption?<br>

							A. We mean that by God&rsquo;s own act, his divine Son received our human nature from the Virgin Mary, his mother.</p>
							<p>Q. Why did he take our human nature?<br>
							A. The divine Son became human, so that in him human beings might be adopted as children of God, and be made heirs of God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
							<p>Q. What is the great importance of Jesus&rsquo; suffering and death?<br>
							A. By his obedience, even to suffering and death, Jesus made the offering which we could not make; in him we are freed from the power of sin and reconciled to God.</p>
							<p>Q. What is the significance of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection?<br>
							A. By his resurrection, Jesus overcame death and opened for us the way of eternal life.</p>
							<p>Q. What do we mean when we say that he descended to the dead?<br>
