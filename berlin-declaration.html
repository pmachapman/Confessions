						<article id="main" class="special">
							<ol type="1" class="decimal articles">
								<li id="a1" data-title="Article 1">
									After serious joint examination of extensive and reliable material, we have come to the following conclusion before the Lord:
									<ol type="1" class="decimal articles">
										<li id="a11" data-title="Article 1.1">The [Pentecostal] movement is inextricably connected to the movements of Los Angeles, Christiana, Hamburg, Kassel, and Grossalmerode. Attempts to deny this connection fail due to the facts at hand.</li>
										<li id="a12" data-title="Article 1.2">The so-called Pentecostal movement is not from above, but from below: it shares many manifestations with Spiritism. Demons are at work within it, who, guided by Satan&rsquo;s cunning, mix lies and truth to deceive the children of God. In many cases, the so-called &ldquo;spirit-gifted&rdquo; have subsequently proven to be possessed.</li>
										<li id="a13" data-title="Article 1.3">The conviction that this movement is from below cannot be shaken by the personal faithfulness and devotion of certain leading brethren, nor by the healings, tongues, prophecies, etc., that accompany the movement. Such signs have often been associated with similar movements, e.g., with Irvingism, and also with &ldquo;Christian Science&rdquo; and Spiritism.</li>
										<li id="a14" data-title="Article 1.4">The spirit of this movement produces spiritual and physical manifestations of power; yet it is a false spirit. It has unmasked itself as such. The ugly manifestations such as falling down, facial twitches, trembling, screaming, loud laughing, etc., are appearing in meetings. We leave open how much of this is demonic, how much is hysterical or emotional; such manifestations are not God-wrought.</li>
										<li id="a15" data-title="Article 1.5">The spirit of this movement introduces itself through the Word of God, but then pushes it into the background through so-called &ldquo;prophecies&rdquo;. (cf. <a href="https://goto.bible/2.Chronicles.18_18-22" target="_blank">2 Chronicles 18:18-22</a>). These prophecies in general pose a great danger; not only have blatant contradictions emerged within them, but they also bring certain brothers and their entire work into slavish dependence on these &ldquo;messages&rdquo;. In the manner of their transmission, these messages resemble those of Spiritist mediums. The transmitters are mostly women. This has, in various places, led the movement to a point where, contrary to the clear instructions of Scripture, women, including young girls, are taking centre stage in leadership.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li id="a2" data-title="Article 2">To recognize such a movement as a gift from God is impossible for us. It is naturally not out of the question that the preaching of the Word of God in the meetings may bear fruit through the inherent power of the Word itself. Inexperienced brethren are deluded by such blessings of the Word of God. This does not change the deceitful character of the entire movement. (See <a href="https://goto.bible/2.Corinthians.11_3~4~14" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 11:3,4,14</a>)</li>
								<li id="a3" data-title="Article 3">The church of God in Germany has reason to humble itself deeply over the fact that this movement could find acceptance. We all take our share of the guilt for our shortcomings and neglect, especially in intercession. The lack of biblical knowledge and foundation, of holy sobriety and watchfulness, a superficial view of sin and grace, and of conversion and rebirth, an arbitrary interpretation of the Bible, the desire for new and exciting manifestations, a tendency toward exaggeration, and above all, hubris, have all paved the way for this movement.</li>
								<li id="a4" data-title="Article 4">In particular, the unbiblical doctrine of the so-called &ldquo;clean heart&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> has become disastrous for many circles, and has promoted the so-called Pentecostal movement. The error here lies in the belief that &ldquo;indwelling sin&rdquo; is eradicated in a justified and sanctified Christian. We firmly hold to the truth that the Lord wants and is able to preserve His own from all stumbling and falling (<a href="https://goto.bible/1.Thessalonians.5_23" target="_blank">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://goto.bible/Jude.24-25" target="_blank">Jude 24-25</a>; <a href="https://goto.bible/Hebrews.13_21" target="_blank">Hebrews 13:21</a>), and that they have the power through the Holy Spirit to rule over sin. But a &ldquo;clean heart&rdquo; goes beyond having to humbly say with Paul, even with God-given and ongoing preservation: &ldquo;For I know nothing against myself, yet am I not justified by this&rdquo;, and is something mankind never receives on earth. Even the most mature Christian must bow before God, who alone is Judge of the true condition of the heart (cf. <a href="https://goto.bible/1.Corinthians.4_4" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>). &ldquo;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us&rdquo; (<a href="https://goto.bible/1.John.1_8" target="_blank">1 John 1:8</a>). In truth, the believer in Christ receives a spotlessly purified heart, but the false doctrine that the heart could attain a state of sinlessness has already brought many children of God under the curse of dishonesty toward sin. It has deceived them regarding sins that still exist in their thought life, in their omissions, or in their falling short of the high commandments of God in their daily lives. One cannot emphasize enough the need to maintain an eye for sin that is not clouded by a human-made sanctification or an imaginary doctrine of the removal of the sinful nature. A lack of brokenness over one&rsquo;s own sin closes the path to new blessings and brings a person under the influence of the enemy. Sad experiences in the present show that where someone claims to have attained a state of sinlessness, the believer may reach the point where he is no longer able to admit an error, let alone confess it. Another sad consequence of false sanctification doctrine is the devaluation of biblical, God-ordained marital life, in that in some places, marital relations between husband and wife are portrayed as incompatible with true sanctification (cf. <a href="https://goto.bible/Genesis.1_28" target="_blank">Genesis 1:28</a> and <a href="https://goto.bible/Ephesians.5_31" target="_blank">Ephesians 5:31</a>).</li>
								<li id="a5" data-title="Article 5">In the so-called Pentecostal movement in Germany, Jonathan Paul stands as the leader before the public. He is the main representative of the unbiblical doctrines previously rejected. We love him as a brother and desire to serve him and the group of his followers in truth. It pains us to have to take a public stand against him. There has been no lack of conversations with him and admonitions within the brotherhood, both near and far. After all efforts have been in vain, we must now, for his sake, and for the sake of God&rsquo;s work, declare the following: We, the undersigned brothers, can no longer recognize him as a leader and teacher in the church of Jesus. We commend him, in love, faith, and hope, to the correcting grace of the Lord.</li>
								<li id="a6" data-title="Article 6">We believe that there was only one Pentecost (<a href="https://goto.bible/Acts.2" target="_blank">Acts 2</a>). We believe in the Holy Spirit, who will remain in the church of Jesus forever (cf. <a href="https://goto.bible/John.14_16" target="_blank">John 14:16</a>). We are fully convinced that the church of God has repeatedly received, and still needs, renewed visitations of grace from the Holy Spirit. To each individual applies the apostle&rsquo;s exhortation: &ldquo;Be filled with the Spirit!&rdquo; (<a href="https://goto.bible/Ephesians.5_18" target="_blank">Ephesians 5:18</a>). The way to this remains complete fellowship with the crucified, risen, and exalted Lord. In Him dwells bodily the fullness of the Spirit, from which we receive grace upon grace. We do not expect a new Pentecost; we are waiting for the returning Lord.</li>
							</ol>
							<p id="c" data-title="Conclusion">We hereby ask all our brethren for the sake of the Lord and His cause, which Satan seeks to corrupt: Keep away from this movement! But whoever among you has fallen under the power of this spirit, let them renounce it and ask God for forgiveness and deliverance. Do not lose heart in the struggles that some may have to go through as a result. Satan will not give up his dominion easily. But be assured: The Lord will carry you through! He has already set many free, and wants to give you the true equipping of the Spirit.</p>
							<p>Our firm confidence in this difficult time is this: God&rsquo;s people will come out of these struggles blessed! You too, dear brethren, who stand shaken by the facts that our words present to you, may tell yourselves this. The Lord will give light to the simple and humble, and He will strengthen and preserve them.</p>
							<p>We place our trust in Jesus, the Chief Shepherd. If each one gives the Lord and His Word the place that is rightfully His, then He will bring the work of His Spirit, which He so graciously began in Germany, to its glorious, God-willed goal. We trust in Him who says: &ldquo;Concerning my children and the work of my hands, command ye me!&rdquo; (<a href="https://goto.bible/Isaiah.45_11" target="_blank">Isaiah 45:11</a> &ndash; literal translation).</p>
