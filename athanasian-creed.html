							<p>Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith; which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</p>
							<p>And the catholic faith is this:</p>
							<h4>Concerning the Trinity</h4>
							<p class="hanging">
								That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;<br>
								neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance.<br>
								For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit.<br>
								But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.<br>
									The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Spirit uncreate.<br>
									The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.<br>
									The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.<br>
									And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.<br>
									As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensibles, but one uncreated and one incomprehensible.<br>
									So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty; and yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.<br>
									So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet they are not three Gods, but one God.<br>
									So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord; so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, &ldquo;There are three Gods or three Lords&rdquo;.<br>
								The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.<br>
								The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten.<br>
								The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.<br>
								So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.<br>
								And in this Trinity none is afore, or after another; none is greater, or less than another.<br>
								But the whole three persons are co-eternal, and co-equal.
							</p>
							<p>So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.</p>
							<p>He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.</p>
							<h4>Concerning the Incarnation</h4>
							<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.<br>
									God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and man of the substance of his mother, born in the world.<br>
									Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.<br>
									Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching his manhood.<br>
									Who, although he is God and man, yet he is not two, but one Christ.<br>
									One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God.<br>
									One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.<br>
									For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ;
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								who suffered for our salvation,<br>
									descended into hell,<br>
									rose again the third day from the dead;<br>
									he ascended into heaven,<br>
									he sits on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty;<br>
									from there he shall come to judge the living and the dead.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;<br>
									and shall give account of their own works.<br>
									And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting,<br>
									and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.
							</p>
							<p>This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.</p>
